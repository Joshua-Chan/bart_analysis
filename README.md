# bart_analysis
Data taken from https://www.bart.gov/about/reports/ridership.
Took the last 8 years of data, cleaned it, looked at some summary statistics, and designed some interesting A/B tests to 
see if BART should have a uniform Weekend train schedule than a segmented Saturday/Sunday train schedule.
